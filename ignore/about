List an experiance & 
what you did in it
like,
how u came out..
what were your thoughts,
what were your thought process,
how u were feeling demotivated, down or whatever.

so that you can help others not go through the same ordeal that you went, 
and probably make the hurdle a little easier for them,

like the same way others are going to help you come out through a hurdle 
that they have gone through.

OR 

Answer others 

who are going through an event/question/diffeculty/happiness in life:
& 
answer them if you have gone through those events, 
and what was your course of action.
