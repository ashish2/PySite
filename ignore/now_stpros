Steps to Problem Solve ( Stpros):

if u face a problem & u hv solved it,
then write about it, 
just write down all the steps involved and the way u solved it...
this helps you remember the solution to a big extent,
to help you face the same problem, if in case you face it again.

now,
Login with FB ( FB Users Table) ( add social network stuff, share(fb) & likes too )
Comments on the Answers.
Design ( like PasteBin )

Is there any kind of streaming service like Twitch.tv but for programmers?
Maybe it's weird... but I really like watching other people writing a project (Like in the Ludum Dare), I like to see how they tackle the design, how they work, what cool tricks they use, etc.
You can even interact with them via chat, and not only help but also ask questions about what they are doing... is great for people who are still learning.
Any?


so there is a solution posted by 1 peson,
& then, there are 5 more solutions posted by different people,
then when X (person X) solves it & he posts his solution,
he can see,
his answer & tries to match with answers from others,
& see with who's answer his answer matches most,
& probably these 2 person have the same way of 
logic & analysing of problems,
we can get to understand,
how the brains of people function,
wen analysing a problem,
& who's brain matches with each other.


i solved a problem,
and here is the trajectory that i followed 
when solving.
Along with the thoughts that came to my mind 
while solving it.
hope someone benefits from this in the future.
Thanks.


stpros:
the site encourages you to note down the way you solved your problem,
write down the whole solution to the problem,
so that you can remember it for some time.
also,
it will be a convenience if someone else,
some other day is facing the same problem, 
he can visit ur answer 
& this could help him solve his problem.

stpros2:
if u hv solved a problem,
and u remember the steps to the solution,
and noting down those steps 
and writing the explanations to an important step in between which might not be very clear
will help someone else 
understand the problem & the solution better,
than you can do it here.
Also,
if you think,
Just noting down the steps to the problem solution,
will actually help you remember the problem better for your own good,
than you can do the same here too,
you can just write down the problem statement, 
the steps to the solutions, 
with appropriate explanations of any step wherever required.
Also,
if u think u hav a problem in hand,
which you hv probably solved,
or half solved,
but u think the steps you have figured out,
are not the best steps to the solution,
and u think you want to ask a question abt the problem,
to know its exact steps to the solution,
or better steps to the solution,
as to how others thought abt the problem,
and solved it,
then you can ask here.

Listing down the Steps, and, Explanation of the Steps, wherever required.

steps to the solution,
formulation of the solution, y u arrived at that particular solution, 
y u think that is `the` solution,
or, for that matter, y is that the best solution, etc.
arrival at the solution, the path of arrival.


> (Just for Fun)
Throw(or Shoot) a problem at someone,
now he has to solve it.
if he can not, 
then 
he can either,
Pass It (pass the problem),
or ask for some help from someone (AskHelp/Guidance on this).
If he finally soves it,
then,
He gets the problem as a Catch taken.

How to make FBUser Functionality?

No need of extra FBUser table.
FBUser will be put in User table with FBFlag: 1
FBUserProfile details should be stored in UserProfile Table
If a user has an fb email & our site login email as same,
dont do anything, set column fbuser_existed_before_as_normal_user to 1.
take, password as session user.password, watever it is, & login the fb_user directly.
