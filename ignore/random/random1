Hey Ayush,

I am working on that assignment.
Though you can check what i have made over here.
http://ec2-54-169-27-73.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com/laughguru/questions/r/1/
Please ignore the Top & bottom bar [Header(Problems, Attendance etc.) & Footer(About, Team etc.) ], 
they will not feature in the software.
Try answering the first question, & see if you see a Next button appearing.
Is it something like this you wanted?
Let me know, if you think this is ok?

Yeah, tell me, anything you wanted to say about the assignment?
You can call me anytime though.

Thanks & Regards,
Ashish.
